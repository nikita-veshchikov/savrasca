1) Start by compiling the course code of SAVRASVA (based on SimulAVR)
 - type "./configure" (in simulavr folder)to configure the makefile
 - type "make" to compile the binaries
 
2) to get an example running
 - use "make" to compile the binary (in "src" folder)
 - start "generateTraces.bash" which will create simulated traces in the folder "traces"
 and it wil also create execution traces in the folder "traces_exe"
