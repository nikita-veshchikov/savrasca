1) Start by compiling the course code of SAVRASVA (based on SimulAVR)
 - type "./configure" (in simulavr folder)to configure the makefile
 - type "make" to compile the binaries
 	
 Note: use "make" or "make -j N" (if you have N cores on your computer make will use all the N during the compilation)
 
2) to get an example running
 - use "make" to compile the binary (in "src" folder of the example that you want to run)
 
 Note: you will need the "avr-gcc" compiler
 
 - start "generateTraces.bash" which will create simulated traces in the folder "traces"
 and it wil also create execution traces in the folder "traces_exe"
