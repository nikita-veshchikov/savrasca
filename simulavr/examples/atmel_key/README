Joel Sherrill Notes
===================

3 March 2009
Temporarily, the Makefile.am is a real Makefile. The rest of the
contents of this directory appear to work with the autotools
tree but the Makefile Knut provided has not yet been converted to
a Makefile.am properly. Until this is complete

make -f Makefile.notauto 
make -f Makefile.notauto clean
