Demonstrates the following Stimulation classes:

	o SpiSink - monitors the /SS, SCLK and MISO pins and prints
		each byte to stdout.

	o SpiSource - drives the /SS, SCLK and MOSI pins with data from
		the spidata file.

	o PinMonitor - monitors Port A Bit 0 and prints changes in its
		binary status to stdout.

	o AdcPin - Stimulates Port F Bit 0 with the values contained
		in the anadata file.

The AVR program alternately (every other byte) echoes the byte received
on the SPI or the ADCH value read from a recenet A/D converter, to the SPI.

The spidata file contains an HDLC encoded stream of *mostly* flags
that was used in my project at work. (We're running a form of
PPP/HDLC over SPI.)

The format of the spidata file consists of comments (lines
that start with a '#') and data lines. Each data line consists
of 3 values.

o First Value - the value (0 or non-zero)of /SS
o Second Value - the value (0 or non-zero) of SCLK
o Third Value - the value (0 or non-zero) of MOSI

When the SpiSource program stimulator reaches the end-of-file,
it rewinds and repeats ad-nauseum.

The anadata file contains analog data that that is read by the
AdcPin class and written to the Port F Bit 0 analog input of
the ATMega128.

The format of the anadata file consists of comments (lines
that start with a '#' character) and analog input lines.
Each input line consists of 2 values separated by whitespace.

o First Value - number of nano-seconds before the next value
	is read and applied to the analog input.
o Second Value - signed integer "analogValue" to be applied
	to the analog input.

To try it:

Step 1:
	Configure and build the simulavr (simulavr.so in particular)

Step 2:
	Build the AVR test program in this directory.
	$ make

Step 3:
	Run the test TCL script from this directory.
	$ check.tcl

Step 4:
	Marvel at the stdio activity.

Step 5:
	Try modifying the spidata file and see the results.


What you'll see on stdout:

Note: Comments added on the right.
