This directory contains some examples of how one can use
the VERILOG simulavrxx interface. Just call

> make example

and after that, use 

> make <file>.run

and then

> make <file>.view

with the base name one of the example files (such as baretest.v ->
make baretest.view), to view the results in gtkwave.

Example:

make example
make vst.run
make vst.view
