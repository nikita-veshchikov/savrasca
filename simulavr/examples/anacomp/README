In that actual directory we have two checks:

make do

and 

make dogdb

do:
Executing "make do" starts a simple gui and enables the user to enter
analog values (0.0 .. 5.0) in the input fields. After entering a new
analog value in ain0 or ain1, you must press the update button!  

At this point, the output of the analog comparator will be used to
determine the output state of the "->B0" field.   "->B0" displays
the start of the Port B 0 pin.  Its value is determined by the
following logic

if ain0 >  ain1  B0 = H(igh)
if ain0 == ain1  B0 = L(ow)
if ain0 <  ain1  B0 = L(ow)

dogdb:
starts also the ddd graphical interface to avr-gdb which will then
connected to simulavr. After the gui from ddd is available and all
files loaded the avr program can be started with the "cont" button.
The breakpoint inside main stops the program flow and you can step/next
to the programm. The gui.tcl enables you to give new analog values to
the ain0 and ain1 pins so you can observe the comparator action as
described above.
