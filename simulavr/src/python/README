README for pysimulavr python module
-----------------------------------

This module will be build, if the following prerequisites are available:

- SWIG is available (see configure.ac in root directory for the proper version)
- Python is available, at least in a proper version (see configure.ac)
- configure was run with the option --enable-python

Status
======

This module is in development. This means, that some modules, which would be available
by libsim are not included in python interface. So, if you need an special interface
or you've found a bug, please send it to simulavr mailinglist or write a bug report
on http://savannah.nongnu.org/simulavr.
