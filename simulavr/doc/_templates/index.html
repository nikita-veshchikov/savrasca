  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>
    The SimulAVR program is a simulator for the
    <a href="http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/">Atmel AVR family</a>
    of microcontrollers. (ATtiny and ATmega) SimulAVR can be used either
    standalone or as a remote target for avr-gdb. There is a python- and TCL
    interface. When used in gdbserver mode, the simulator is used as a
    back-end so that avr-gdb can be used as a source level debugger for AVR
    programs.</p>

  <p>
    SimulAVR started out as a C based project written by Theodore Roth in 2001.
    Klaus Rudolph started then in 2004 to rewrite the hardware simulation part
    in C++. Only the instruction decoder and the avr-gdb interface are mostly
    copied from the original simulavr sources. This C++ based version was known
    as simulavrxx until it became feature compatibile with the old simulavr
    code, then it renamed back to simulavr.</p>

    We have a <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/simulavr-devel">
    development mailing list</a>
    (<a href="http://lists.gnu.org/pipermail/simulavr-devel">see archive</a>) and

    Please read more <a href="{{ pathto('contents') }}">about activities,
    plans, releases, download</a> and so one.</p>
  
  <p>
    We hold also the "old" code and releases from simulavr and simulavrxx for
    maintenance and for comparison reasons. There is some maintenance for the
    "old" C based simulavr, especially to support projects, which use simulavr.
    <b>But we recommend to use the new simulavr version soon!</b></p>
