Developer:
	Klaus Rudolph       <lts-rudolph@gmx.de>  

        rivetwa says: Klaus is the guy to thank for simulavrxx. He
        has single-handedly taken on the entire coding task of the
        survivor to simulavr to date. He has added many real-world
        capabilities that have made simulavr useful as a simulator. He
        has provided methods to interact with multiple independent
        simulavr instances and simulated hardware. I can't wait to see
        where else he takes this project.

Patches submitted by Oleg Batrashev:
    - configure.ac & src/Makefile.am to complain about missing swig,
        and to flow TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC to output makefile.

Patched submitted by Russell Shaw:
    - bootstrap & configure.ac patch to cleanup use of autotools. It
        was very welcome to see tcl features updated to use
        tclConfig.sh and my silly echo's replaced as well.

Patches submitted by elonen:
    - initial Python bindings via SWIG
    - change to SystemClock submitted too (not yet accepted)
